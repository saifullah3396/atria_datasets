"""
Aspect Ratio Group Batch Sampler Module

This module defines the `AspectRatioGroupBatchSampler` class, which is a batch
sampler that groups input sample images based on their aspect ratios. It extends
the `GroupBatchSampler` and uses a grouping strategy to improve training efficiency
for models sensitive to input dimensions.

Classes:
    - AspectRatioGroupBatchSampler: A batch sampler that groups samples based on
        their aspect ratios.

Dependencies:
    - torch: For dataset sampling utilities.
    - atria_datasets.core.batch_samplers.group_batch_sampler: Base class for group batch samplers.
    - atria_datasets.core.batch_samplers.utilities: Utility functions for creating aspect ratio groups.
    - atria_registry: For registering the batch sampler.

    This sampler extends the `GroupBatchSampler` and uses a grouping strategy

    efficiency for models sensitive to input dimensions.
