"""
Msgpack Shard Writer Module

This module defines the `MsgpackFileWriter` and `MsgpackShardWriter` classes, which provide
utilities for writing datasets to Msgpack-based shard files. These classes support writing
data in chunks, managing shard sizes, and handling unique keys for dataset samples.

Classes:
    - MsgpackFileWriter: A writer for file-based datasets that ensures unique keys for samples.
    - MsgpackShardWriter: A writer for managing dataset shards with configurable size and count limits.

Dependencies:
    - typing: For type annotations.
    - datadings.writer.Writer: For writing Msgpack-based datasets.
    - atria_core.logger: For logging utilities.
